Original dataset can be processed if there are special requirements.
Masked dataset is a dataset that can directly train a large model.
News story tree dataset and news timeline dataset are test datasets that only contains chains without correct prediction results.
The directly usable dataset has been uploaded at this link. Because the data is so large, we will post all the news text and story trees from the data processing process here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12kLQcEhtYKfsWGijpKjXox_kn9IQcLp9/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EswkEo3uyayWmGeYaoMCgbc8Tj5OM9v3/view?usp=sharing).
